# ARM Project

Welcome to the ARM Project repository! This project focuses on developing a game application using ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) architecture.

## Project Overview

The ARM Project repository contains code written in C for a game application. The application utilizes ARM architecture and is designed to run on ARM-based microcontrollers or embedded systems. Here's a brief overview of the project files:

- **LPC17xx.h**: Header file containing definitions for LPC17xx microcontroller.
- **GLCD.h**: Header file for graphics LCD display.
- **game.h**: Header file containing game-related definitions and function prototypes.
- **stdlib.h**: Standard library header file.
- **timer.h**: Header file for timer functions.
- **stdio.h**: Standard I/O header file.

## Functionality

The game application includes the following functionality:

- Initialization of game attributes such as ball, paddles, and walls.
- Resetting the game state.
- Drawing game elements on the graphics LCD display.
- Handling game logic including ball movement, collision detection, and score tracking.
- Generating sound effects using timers.

## How to Use

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Set up the development environment for ARM-based microcontrollers.
2. Include the necessary header files and source code files in your project.
3. Configure the hardware peripherals as required for your specific setup.
4. Compile and flash the code onto the target device.
5. Run the application and enjoy the game!
